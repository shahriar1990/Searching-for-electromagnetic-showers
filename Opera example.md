OPERA Example
• Each BaseTrack(BT) is described by: 
－Coordinates: (X, Y, Z) －Angles in the brick-frame: (TX, TY) 
－Goodness of fit of Ag crystals to the BT:X
Background consists of basetracks (BT) randomly scattered around brick. In real brick there are ~ 107 tracks = label=0

Signal consists of BTs forming a cone-like shape. There are about 103 BTs per shower. label=1
• Origin and Energy of the shower is known (X0, Y0, Z0, TX0, TY0, E0)
